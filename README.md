# Uncovering the HML Factor

The notebooks in this repository demonstrate the systematic top-bottom decomposition approach towards uncovering the HML factor introduced in the Fama-French three-factor ([1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X93900235)) model.

Within the intermediate step illustratted by [UV.gpoa.ipynb](https://github.com/ymalitskaia/uncovering-value/blob/main/UV.gpoa.ipynb), the approach describes the HML factor as a sampling of stocks based on the GPOA (gross profits over assets) fundamental characteristic. The corresponding results transparently address the redundancy question pertaining to the HML factor raised by the five-factor model including the profitability and investment factors ([Fama and French, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X14002323); [Asness et al., 2015](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/42/1/34.abstract)).
